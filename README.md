# Matlab Project
This is a repository to play with a simple Matlab project and to see how it interacts with Github.
## Markdown syntax
For some reason, the Matlab interface does not seem to render a preview of the Markdown syntax. However, Visual Studio Code is a capable tool to view such features.
## Purpose
I am not yet sure what I want to achieve with this project. However, I hope it will evolve into something useful as I try out some of the features.
Ideas so far include:
[ ] Branching of projects
[ ] Merging of projects
[ ] Interfacing to external code
